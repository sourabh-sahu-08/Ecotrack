# EcoTrack — Environmental Clearance Portal

EcoTrack (PARIVESH 3.0) is a next-generation environmental clearance platform designed for the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Government of India. It leverages Groq AI to offer intelligent risk analysis, automated report summaries, and transparent public monitoring.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI Risk Scoring**: Automatic environmental risk assessment for projects based on topography, pollution metrics, and forest impact.
- **Satellite Comparison**: Interactive "Before vs After" satellite imagery tracking to monitor land-use changes and deforestation (e.g., Western Ghats Highway Project).
- **AI Permit Advisor**: Intelligent guidance for applicants on required environmental, forest, and wildlife clearances.
- **Meeting Gist**: AI-generated summaries of environmental review meetings.
- **Public Transparency**: Dedicated dashboard for citizens to view projects, submit comments, and verify environmental complaints via AI.
- **Real-time IoT/GIS**: Mock integration for sensor data and satellite-based change detection.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Motion (Framer), Lucide Icons.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Better-SQLite3, JWT Authentication.
- **AI Engine**: Groq AI (groq-1).

## 💻 Local Setup
